--- Reddit commands ---
To execute a command on the Reddit bot, type "u/ByteDiceAssistant [args]" in a comment.
[args] should be replaced with a command:

add     - Adds the post the command was ran in to the list of posts.

EXAMPLES:
u/ByteDiceAssistant add

You can even do this: (without the quotes)
  """
  Hey guys welcome back to my lets play, today we are checking out original art.
  Wow, this art is original and cool.

  u/ByteDiceAssistant add

  I want this art to be recognized
  """
and this:
  "Cool art. u/ByteDiceAssistant add
and this:
  """
  Cool art. u/ByteDiceAssistant add
  Very cool.
  """

But you cant do this: (without the quotes)
  "Cool art. u/ByteDiceAssistant add very cool."
  "Cool art. u/ByteDiceAssistant add. Very cool."
  "Cool art. u/ByteDiceAssistant add." (Notice the period?)
