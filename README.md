### How to run:
### Short answer for experienced people:
* Download the code.
* Set the environment variables (listed above).
* Restart the terminal.
* Navigate to the project root directory.
* Install all Python modules. (`pip install -r req.txt`)
* Run with `cargo run`. 
  * Alternatively, run `cargo run -- {args here}` to add args.
  * For help, run `cargo run -- -h` or `cargo run -- --help`.
  * To only run the Python part, use `cargo run -- --py`, or for a better error output, `python ./src/python/main.py`

### Long answer for beginners:
* Download the code (and extract it if needed).
* Open a terminal.
* Set the environment variables (listed above).
  * On Windows:
    * Run `setx VARIABLE_NAME "value in quotes"` in a terminal.
    
  * On Linux:
    * Run `sudo nano /etc/environment` or `sudo vim /etc/environment` in the terminal (and enter your password if prompted to).
    * Press `i` (only if you used VIM).
    * Write `VARIABLE_NAME="value"` + a new line for every variable.
    * if nano: `ctrl + O` (and press enter) then `ctrl + X`.
    * if VIM: press `esc` then write `:wq` (and press enter).

  * On macOS:
    * Probably the same as Linux, but I don't use this OS so I have no clue.

* Restart the terminal if you added/changed any environment variables.
* Run `cd path/to/extracted/folder` to navigate to the downloaded files (replace `path/to/extracted/folder` with your actual path).
* Install all python modules with `pip install -r req.txt`.
* Run `cargo run` to start the program. You can view a list of options by running `cargo run -- --help` or `cargo run -- -h`.
  * If you only want to run the Python code, you can either run `cargo run -- --py` or `python ./src/python/main.py`. The second option is recommended for better error output.
