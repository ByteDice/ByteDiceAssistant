## How to run
### Dependencies:

This program uses Rust (v1.82.0) and Python (v3.11.4), you can likely use other versions if they are compatible. This program also uses these Python modules:
* asyncio
* asyncpraw
* asyncprawcore
* emoji
* io
* json
* os
* sys
* threading
* time
* typing
* websockets

You can install Python modules by running `$ pip install {module}` or `$ python -m pip install {module}` in a terminal.

### Environment variables:
| **Name** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| `ASSISTANT_TOKEN` | The Discord bot token. (Create a Discord bot [here](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro)!) |
| `ASSISTANT_TOKEN_TEST` | (Optional) A testing Discord bot token. This is only needed when the program is run with `-t` or `--test`. |
| `ASSISTANT_R_ID` | The id for the Reddit bot/account. (Create a Reddit bot [here](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps)!)  |
| `ASSISTANT_R_TOKEN` | The token for the Reddit bot/account. |
| `ASSISTANT_R_NAME` | The username of the Reddit bot/account. |
| `ASSISTANT_R_PASS` | The password for the Reddit bot/account. |
| `ASSISTANT_OWNERS` | (OPTIONAL) A list of Discord user IDs that "own" the bot. Separate each ID with a single comma and **no** spaces. This will allow the specified user IDs to run root commands such as `/stop`, it will also DM these users when *certain* errors occur. |
| `ASSISTANT_BK_MODS` | (OPTIONAL) Same format as `ASSISTANT_OWNERS` but for people who are allowed to use the `/bk_week` commands. |

### How to run:
### Short answer for experienced people:
* Download the code.
* Set the environment variables (listed above).
* Restart the terminal.
* Navigate to the project root directory.
* Run with `cargo run`. 
  * Alrenatively, run `cargo run -- {args here}` to add args.
  * For help, run `cargo run -- -h` or `cargo run -- --help`.
  * To only run the Python part, use `cargo run -- --py`, or for a better error output, `python ./src/python/main.py`

### Long answer for absolute beginners:
* Download the code (and extract it if needed).
* Open a terminal.
* Set the environment variables (listed above).
  * On Windows:

    * Run `setx VARIABLE_NAME "value in quotes"` in a terminal.
    
  * On Unix (Linux / Mac):
    * Run `sudo nano /etc/environment` or `sudo vim /etc/environment` in the terminal (and enter your password if prompted to).
    * Press `i` (only if you used VIM).
    * Write `VARIABLE_NAME="value"` + a new line for every variable.
    * if nano: `ctrl + O` (and press enter) then `ctrl + X`.
    * if VIM: press `esc` then write `:wq` (and press enter).
* Restart the terminal if you added/changed any environment variables.
* Run `cd path/to/extracted/folder` to navigate to the downloaded files (replace `path/to/extracted/folder` with your actual path).
* Run `cargo run` to start the program. You can view a list of options by running `cargo run -- --help` or `cargo run -- -h`.
  * If you only want to run the Python code, you can either run `cargo run -- --py` or `python ./src/python/main.py`. The second option is recommended for better error output.
